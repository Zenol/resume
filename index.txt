Since June 2014
    Data Scientist for Amadeus Travel Intelligence (Munich, Germany).

    Participated in the general architecture of the team’s platform,
    suggesting and implementing various improvements. Implemented an
    authenticating layer on top of nginx and lua. Implemented
    generalized logging based on ELK and HAproxy, deployed with chef.
    Participated in organizing devops activities. Worked on the redesign
    of a large scale model for estimating passenger traffic over airline
    networks.

Nov 2013-Jun 2014
    Data Scientist for Airconomy (Frankfurt am Main, Germany).

    Hadoop-based Mining on Travel Industry Data. Implemented Flask web
    services, shipped as debian package and continuously integrated with
    Jenkins.

2009-2012
    PhD in Operations Research with Amadeus (Sophia Antipolis, France).

    Researched how to assign aircraft on an airline network in the most
    efficient way. I authored several projects, including a C++ solver,
    a Python suite of 20+ command line tools, and Hadoop data mining
    scripts. I also worked as a teaching assistant at the university,
    further improving my communication and public speaking skills.

2008 (3 months)
    Internship at Rio Tinto Alcan (Clermont Ferrand, France).

    Co-authored a C++ library for optimizing the revenue of a metal
    factory. This work was published in the corporate journal of the

2007 (3 months)
    Internship at GE Healthcare (Paris, France).

    Elaborated an UML spec for the refactoring of 20.000 lines of C++.

Selected Open Source Contributions

    Contributor to pulp-or, a linear programming Python library. Author
    of small tools, like michel, a command line program providing
    bidirectionnal synchronization of google tasks with text files.

C++
    Author of yaposib, a Python binding to COIN-OSI that is now
    supported by pulp-or.

C
